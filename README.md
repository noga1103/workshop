# Machine Learning Workshop: 
# Kaggle Prompt Engineering (Math) Contest
Welcome to our Machine Learning workshop project! In this project, we participated in a Kaggle contest focused on prompt engineering.
The objective of the competition was to build the best prompt to assist a language model (LLM) in solving a simple math task.

## Overview
This competition emphasizes prompt engineering, allowing participants to modify any part of the generation pipeline to improve performance.
The key requirement is reproducibility, ensuring that the solution depends only on public libraries and models.

## Goal
The primary goal is to construct an effective prompt to aid LLMs in solving a basic math problem.
The competition evaluates participants based on the accuracy of their solutions.

## Evaluation 
- **Primary Metric**: Accuracy
- **Secondary Metric**: Average cost of work per task

### Repository Content
Our repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks documenting our various attempts during the competition.
Additionally, it includes CSV files utilized or generated throughout our work. Each code file and CSV is accompanied by a brief commit description message explaining its purpose.
